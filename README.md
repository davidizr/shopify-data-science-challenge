# shopify-data-science-challenge
Here is my Shopify Summer 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge. 
Question 1 was done in R (R Studio) using base R and ggplot2 to graph outliers. The R file is in the repository as well as the violin graph. 

### Quick answers:
  Question 1)
    
    a) The calculation is going wrong because there are outliers in the data which are dragging the average up by a significant margin. Using the summary function, it's obvious that there is some serious deviation. The outliers can be sone on the violin graph.
    
    b) When mean is unreliable due to high deviation or outliers, median is a simple and intuitive way of looking at the midpoint of data. I outlined two other options such as average of purchases under $10,000 and the average of the interquartile range. Median is the most intiuitve and easiest to deploy/understand
    
    c) The value of the median is $284. Comparatively, mean of sales less than or equal to $10,000 is $302.58. With the mean of interquartile is $275.41
  
  Question 2)
    
    a) 54
    
    b) "Peacock"
    
    c) "Boston Crab Mean"
